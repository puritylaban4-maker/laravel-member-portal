## Project architecture

- Treat the Laravel backend contract and its existing role hierarchy as authoritative; this project modernizes presentation without redefining permissions or business flows.
- Keep the dashboard UI data isolated as frontend display data until the canonical Laravel client files are supplied, preventing accidental contract invention.
